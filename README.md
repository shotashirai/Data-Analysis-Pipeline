# Data Analysis Pipeline

The purpose of the pipeline in this repository is to provide analysis tools that can eliminate and reduce boring and repetitive tasks in data analysis.

## Pipeline

"my_pipeline" directory provides analysis tools for load/save files, data cleaning/feature engineering and modelling. The pipeline can be used for future data analysis and reduce coding tasks.

## Analysis Codes

In this repository, there are two codes to analyse data:

- TitanicSurvivorPrediction.py  

- UberDemandPrediction.py  
  
These analysis codes were developed based on the insights obtained from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a jupyter notebook (see links below).
Titanic survival prediction is a binary classification task and Uber demand forecasting is time-series forecasting. These are different types of tasks, but some basic analysis can be done with common analysis tools.
